          <h5>  The first time we met, L, my heart beat fast,
            A connection was made, that just couldn't last.
            Your presence inspired me, to work so hard,
            To catch your eye, and show you my heart.
            
            Your smile so bright, your laughter so sweet,
            Draws me in, makes my heart skip a beat.
            I hit the books, with a new determination,
            Hoping that you'd see my admiration.
            
            So here I am, with these words I write,
            Expressing my feelings, with all my might.
            You're my crush, my love, and my heart's desire,
            And I'll always hold you, close to my heart's fire.
         </h5>
