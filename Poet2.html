        <h4>A Radiant Light in Dark Days: A tribute to L</h4>
        <br>

                       Darkness once reigned, with nothing but night,
                  Days felt empty, with no end in sight.
                  But then came L, with a warm and gentle glow,
                  And the darkness receded, no longer in control.

                  With laughter and love, L brought new life,
                  And the days were filled with joy, without any strife.
                  The light within L, cast away all fears,
                  And the darkness that once loomed, now disappeared.

                  So here's to L, a light in the dark days,
                  A beacon of hope, that always finds its ways.
                  Through all life's struggles, L stands bright and true,
                  Guiding us always, with a love that shines anew.
