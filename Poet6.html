        <h4>"Unfulfilled Love: A Tale of Avoidance and Longing"</h4>
        <br>
        
          <h5>   try to turn away, to hide from sight,
            To escape the pain, to win the fight.
            Our love is one-sided, that's evident and true,
            Yet my heart still hurts, with every day anew.
            I thought that distance would ease the pain,
            That time would heal, what love had gained.
            But every time I try to move on,
            I find myself drawn, to you alone.
            
            I thought I'd find peace, when you were gone,
            That I'd forget you, with each new dawn.
            But your smile lingers, in my mind,
            And every thought of you, is just so kind.
            
            I tell myself, to walk away,
            To find someone new, each passing day.
            But every time I try, I find,
            That I keep falling, deeper in your mind.
            
            So I'll keep avoiding, the love I feel,
            And try to hide, what's real.
            But deep inside, I know it's true,
            That I keep falling, more in love with you.
