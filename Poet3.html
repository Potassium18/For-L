        <h4>"Autumn's Embrace: A Love for L"</h4>
        <br>  
          <h5>Winter's chill, Summer's heat,
            Autumn's hues, and Spring's sweet.
            Seasons come, and seasons go,
            Bringing change, to the world below.
            
            But in the midst of all this change,
            There's one aura, that never will wane.
            The autumnal aura of L, so warm and bright,
            That in its glow, I fell in love, with all my might.
            
            With every leaf that falls, I'm filled with delight,
            And the love I feel, shines so pure and bright.
            In the autumn of my heart, I'll always stay,
            And love L, till the end of time, come what may.
         </h5>
