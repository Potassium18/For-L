         <h4>"One-Sided Love: A Tribute to L"</h4>
         <br>
         
           <h5>Love, sky, L and I,
          Inseparable once, now only a sigh.
          For though my heart aches, with love so true,
          Being with L, is something I can't do.
        
          For she sees me not, as a lover, but friend,
          And my heart is left broken, love never to extend.
          I gaze up at the sky, and imagine we're there,
          Together, hand in hand, without a single care.
        
          But reality hits, and I'm brought back to earth,
          With a love so strong, yet only known to me and its worth.
          I cherish the memories, and the thought of what could be,
          But in this one sided love, Lexy and I cannot be.
        
          So I'll love from afar, and keep it all inside,
          And hope one day, she'll see me, and my love will no longer hide.
          For though the sky may stretch, and love may never bloom,
          My love for L, will forever be my heart's room.
          </h5>
